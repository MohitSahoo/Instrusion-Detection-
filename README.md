# Instrusion-Detection-
This project is a lightweight Intrusion Detection System that uses string matching algorithms (Naive, Boyer-Moore, Horspool) to scan HTTP network logs for malicious patterns. It includes a visualizer to demonstrate how each algorithm detects threats like SQL Injection, XSS, LFI, Command Injection, and more in real time.
